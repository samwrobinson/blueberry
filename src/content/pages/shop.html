                <p class="cs-text">
                    Blueberry Lake Cross Country Center, nestled in the scenic Mad River Valley of East Warren, Vermont, offers a serene and immersive outdoor experience for winter enthusiasts. Our 35 kilometers of meticulously groomed trails cater to classic skiing, skate skiing, snowshoeing, and fat biking, accommodating all skill levels. The network features both wooded paths and open meadows, providing breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    In light of recent transitions, we are focusing on providing season passes for the upcoming season. While the lodge will not be operational this year, our commitment to maintaining the quality and accessibility of our trails remains steadfast. We encourage visitors to plan accordingly, as on-site amenities will be limited.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    Our trails are engineered and graded to enhance your skiing experience, with daily grooming to ensure optimal conditions. We welcome well-behaved dogs on our trails; please ensure they are under control and that you clean up after them.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    For the latest trail conditions and updates, please refer to our TrailHub App, which provides real-time geolocation tracking on our GPS-mapped trails. We highly recommend downloading the app and loading the Blueberry Lake Cross Country trail system onto your mobile device for the most current information.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    We appreciate your understanding during this period of transition and look forward to providing you with a memorable outdoor experience at Blueberry Lake Cross Country Center.
